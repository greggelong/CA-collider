# CA-collider
## 1d cellular automata collider. It computes different rules for odd and even generations.
### Here's me thinking cellular automata, CA, has never been more popular.  However google analytics tells me differently. Yet, I am still on an on about it.  The recent death of John Conway who invented the Game of Life and then just a couple weeks later Stephen Wolfram's new physics project based on computation of simple rules.  What's more, in last October Wolfram set a prize for proving 3 problems dealing with his rule 30 CA, concerning its randomness, color, and the computational effort it takes to produce it.  CA's are certainly an interesting topic and great distraction. Wolfram's problems are interesting and with time on my hands I have been just looking at what sort of effort it would take to come up with an answer. It requires an academic Mathematical proof and more too. yikes!  But sometimes smashing things together helps.  That's what I am doing here.  A collider of sorts for Wolfram 1d CAs. It computes different rules on odd and even generations.  The first rule's pixels are yellow the second rule's are red.  These mash ups show some interesting properties. such as some the order makes very little difference but not for others.   And very random rules become repetitive when paired with a repetitive rule.   #p5js
